# ospf-backbone
This repository contains a simple network topology demonstrating the configuration of OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) in a backbone area. The topology includes three routers enabled with OSPF, two switches, and two PCs. This setup is designed to illustrate the fundamentals of OSPF routing within a single OSPF area (backbone area 0).
