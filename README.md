# Description
This repository contains a simple network topology demonstrating the configuration of OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) in a backbone area. The topology includes three routers enabled with OSPF, two switches, and two PCs. This setup is designed to illustrate the fundamentals of OSPF routing within a single OSPF area (backbone area 0).

# Features
- OSPF Configuration: Demonstrates basic OSPF configuration and neighbor relationships in a backbone area.
- Inter-Router Communication: Shows how routers exchange routing information using OSPF.
- Network Topology Diagram: A visual representation of the network topology to help understand the setup and configuration steps.
